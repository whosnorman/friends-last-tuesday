        LAST TUESDAY, July 19 - Sunday, July 21

After a book or series of books is sealed into a solid form, he cuts into the surface, reading with his knife one page or layer at a time. Fragmented images, words and ideas emerge to expose and create new relationships within the book's internal elements.
